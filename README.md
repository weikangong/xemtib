# JS Interview questions

### Installation

```
yarn
```

### Start servers

Run the json-server api in one terminal window:

```
yarn serve-api
```

and run the react native app in another terminal window

```
yarn start
```

### Test Instructions

The api should now be running at [http://localhost:3334/volume](http://localhost:3334/volume) and the mobile app should be built.

Instructions for the mobile test are found in `./App.js`. This file should be opened in the editor for the candidate.

```
Create an unordered list using React that lists the top 5 exchanges by volume of currency type Bitcoin
(BTC) in descending order given the api endpoint: http://localhost:3334/volume

Work the way you are most comfortable and treat this as an everyday task. You are allowed to ask
questions, look up documentation and search for answers.
